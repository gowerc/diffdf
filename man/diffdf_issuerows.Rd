\title{Identify Issue Rows}
\usage{
diffdf_issuerows(df, diff, vars = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe to be subsetted}

\item{diff}{diffdf object}

\item{vars}{(optional) character vector containing names of issue variables to subset dataframe
on. A value of NULL (default) will be taken to mean available issue variables.}
}
\description{
This function takes a \code{diffdf} object and a dataframe and subsets
the \code{data.frame} for problem rows as identified in the comparison object.
If \code{vars} has been specified only issue rows associated with those
variable(s) will be returned.
}
\details{
Note that \code{diffdf_issuerows} can be used to subset against any dataframe. The only
requirement is that the original variables specified in the keys argument to diffdf
are present on the dataframe you are subsetting against. However please note that if
no keys were specified in diffdf then the row number is used. This means using
\code{diffdf_issuerows} without a keys against an arbitrary dataset can easily result in
nonsense rows being returned. It is always recommended to supply keys to diffdf.
}
\examples{
iris2 <- iris
for (i in 1:3) iris2[i, i] <- 99
x <- diffdf(iris, iris2, suppress_warnings = TRUE)
diffdf_issuerows(iris, x)
diffdf_issuerows(iris2, x)
diffdf_issuerows(iris2, x, vars = "Sepal.Length")
diffdf_issuerows(iris2, x, vars = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width"))
