#' diffdf_issuerows
#' 
#' This function takes a diffdf object and a dataframe and subsets
#' the dataframe for problem rows as identified in the comparison object.
#' If \code{vars} has been specified only issue rows associated with those
#' variable(s) will be returned. 
#' @param df dataframe to be subsetted
#' @param diff diffdf object
#' @param vars (optional) character vector containing names of issue variables to subset dataframe 
#' on. A value of NULL (default) will be taken to mean available issue variables.
#' @examples 
#' iris2 <- iris
#' for ( i in 1:3) iris2[i,i] <- 99
#' x <- diffdf( iris , iris2, warnings = FALSE)
#' diffdf_issuerows( iris , x)
#' diffdf_issuerows( iris2 , x)
#' diffdf_issuerows( iris2 , x , vars = "Sepal.Length")
#' diffdf_issuerows( iris2 , x , vars = c("Sepal.Length" , "Sepal.Width"))
#' @details 
#' Note that diffdf_issuerows can be used to subset against any dataframe. The only
#' requirement is that the original variables specified in the keys argument to diffdf
#' are present on the dataframe you are subsetting against. However please note that if 
#' no keys were specified in diffdf then the row number is used. This means using 
#' diffdf_issuerows without a keys against an arbitrary dataset can easily result in 
#' nonsense rows being returned. It is always recommended to supply keys to diffdf.
