`diffdf` compares two `data.frame` objects and provides a detailed summary of any differences that were found between them. The package has it's origins in supporting QC workflows for product development within the pharmaceutical industry aiming at being a light weight alternative to SAS's `PROC COMPARE`.

Currently diffdf supports the following:

- Checking for differences in:
  - Values
  - Attributes
  - Classes
  - Column names
  - Number of observations
  - Column ordering
- Matching rows by key/id variables
- Fuzzy comparisons (i.e. treating doubles and integers as the same)
- Extracting datasets of different rows

For more information on features please consult the vignette and man pages.
